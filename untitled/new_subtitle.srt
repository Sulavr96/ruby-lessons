1
00:01:14,888 --> 00:01:16,598
Now, I know what you're thinking.

2
00:01:16,765 --> 00:01:20,135
"Oh, no! Thor's in a cage.
How did this happen?"

3
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,100
Well, sometimes you have to get captured

4
00:01:22,187 --> 00:01:23,987
just to get a straight answer
out of somebody.

5
00:01:25,315 --> 00:01:28,435
It's a long story,
but basically, I'm a bit of a hero.

6
00:01:29,903 --> 00:01:32,203
See, I spent some time on Earth...

7
00:01:32,656 --> 00:01:35,736
Fought some robots,
saved the planet a couple of times.

8
00:01:36,034 --> 00:01:37,664
Then I went searching through the cosmos

9
00:01:37,744 --> 00:01:40,664
for some magic,
colorful Infinity Stone things.

10
00:01:41,456 --> 00:01:43,956
Didn't find any.
