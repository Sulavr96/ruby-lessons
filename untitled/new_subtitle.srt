1
00:01:04,888 --> 00:01:06,598
Now, I know what you're thinking.

2
00:01:06,765 --> 00:01:10,135
"Oh, no! Thor's in a cage.
How did this happen?"

3
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,100
Well, sometimes you have to get captured

4
00:01:12,187 --> 00:01:13,987
just to get a straight answer
out of somebody.

5
00:01:15,315 --> 00:01:18,435
It's a long story,
but basically, I'm a bit of a hero.

6
00:01:19,903 --> 00:01:22,203
See, I spent some time on Earth...

7
00:01:22,656 --> 00:01:25,736
Fought some robots,
saved the planet a couple of times.

8
00:01:26,034 --> 00:01:27,664
Then I went searching through the cosmos

9
00:01:27,744 --> 00:01:30,664
for some magic,
colorful Infinity Stone things.

10
00:01:31,456 --> 00:01:33,956
Didn't find any.
