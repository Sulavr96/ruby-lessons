1
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,598
Now, I know what you're thinking.

2
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:00,135
"Oh, no! Thor's in a cage.
How did this happen?"

3
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,100
Well, sometimes you have to get captured

4
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,987
just to get a straight answer
out of somebody.

5
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:08,435
It's a long story,
but basically, I'm a bit of a hero.

6
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,203
See, I spent some time on Earth...

7
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:15,736
Fought some robots,
saved the planet a couple of times.

8
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,664
Then I went searching through the cosmos

9
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,664
for some magic,
colorful Infinity Stone things.

10
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,956
Didn't find any.
